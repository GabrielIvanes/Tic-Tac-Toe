# Tic-Tac-Toe

----------------------------

How the app works ? 

The green circle shows which player should play.

To play, just click where you want your token to be.

If player 1 or player 2 win, you need to press the reset button (the button in the middle of the top banner) after closing the dialog. 

In case of draw, the game resets automatically after closing the dialog. 

If you want to reset the scoreboard, just refresh the page.
